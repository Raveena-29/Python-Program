**Arithmetic Operators**
|OPERATORS|NAME|MEANING|EXAMPLE|
|---|---|---|---|
|+|Addition| Add two operands or unary plus	|x + y = 7|
|–|	Subtraction| Subtract right operand from the left|	x – y = 3|
|*|	Multiplication| Multiplies two operands	|x * y = 10|
|/|	Division| Divides left operand by the right one	|x / y = 2.5|
|%|	Modulus | Takes the remainder	|x % y = 1|
|//|	Floor division| Division that results into the whole number truncating digits after decimal point|	x // y = 2|
|**	|Exponent |left operand raised to the power of right | x**y (5^2) = 25|

**Python Relational Operator or Comparison Operator**
Relational or Comparison Operators are used to compare the operands on the either side of them

|OPERATOR|	MEANING|EXAMPLE|
|---|---|---|
|>	Greater than: Eg. x > y will return true if x is greater than y
|<	Less than: Eg. x < y will return true if x is less than y
|==	Equal to: Eg. x == y will return true if x is equal to y
|!=	Not equal to: x != y will return true if x is not equal to y
|>=	Greater Than or Equal to: Eg. x >= y will return true if x is greater than or equal to y
|<=	Less Than or Equal to: Eg. x <= y will return true if x is less than or equal to y
